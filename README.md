# UDM_camb

This code is a simple modification to the standard CAMB code.
The matter transfer function is modified in such a way to mimic the 
effects of "quartessence" models.

The code allows to investigate the effect of these models on CMB and
LSS observables, with the inclusion of a single extra parameter (c_inf,
added in the params.ini) which determines the effective speed of sound
of the unified Dark Matter-Dark Energy component.

The code is based on the equations of

Piattella, Bertacca 2011 https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0234

and it has been used for 

Camera, Martinelli, Bertacca https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06277

Please, refer to these paper in case you use the code.
